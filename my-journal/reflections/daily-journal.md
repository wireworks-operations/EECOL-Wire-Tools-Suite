**UI Layout Learning - Category Controls Alignment Challenge:**
Lucas identified that the reel configurations section was positioned lower than other sections due to additional category controls. We explored two layout solutions:

**Attempt 1: Inline Controls**
- Placed search, sort, category filter, and clear button all on one row
- **Issue**: Controls clipped at container edges due to insufficient space
- **Result**: Functional but visually problematic

**Attempt 2: Stacked Controls**
- Search input on top row (full width)
- Sort, category filter, clear button on second row
- Add category controls on third row
- **Issue**: Resolved clipping but maintained original positioning offset
- **Result**: Clean layout, no clipping, but sections still not perfectly aligned

**Key Learning**: Complex control sets require careful layout planning. Sometimes functional design takes precedence over perfect visual alignment when both cannot be achieved simultaneously. The category system works perfectly - the minor alignment difference is acceptable for the significant functionality gained.

**With professional execution, successful testing, and enthusiastic user validation,**

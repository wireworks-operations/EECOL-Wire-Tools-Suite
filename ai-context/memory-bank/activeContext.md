## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Rebuild Multi-Cut Planner from Scratch (Standalone)**
   - **Decision**: Complete ground-up rebuild as standalone tool
   - **Reason**: Previous integration approach broke reel estimators, caused cascading failures
   - **Approach**: Self-contained tool without cross-tool dependencies
   - **Requirements**: All functionality internal, no external tool integrations
   - **Timeline**: Start immediately after current stabilization

2. **Bug Investigation & Fixes**
   - Reel Size Estimator reported issues (from changelog prioritization)
   - Live Statistics dashboard localStorage fallback crash
   - Verify reel estimators working after selective revert

3. **Architecture Transition Planning**
   - Begin v2.0.0 transition planning
   - Enterprise authentication system design
   - Gun.js P2P integration architecture

### Medium-Term Goals
- Complete standalone Multi-Cut Planner rebuild
- Implement education hub enhancements
- Add feedback collection system
- PWA offline enhancement improvements

### Long-Term Vision
- Full v2.0.0 migration with enterprise features
- Role-based authentication implementation
- Multi-channel notification system
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION RULE
**Status**: ACTIVE - UNSKIPPABLE
**Created**: October 29, 2025
**Enforcement**: ALL FUTURE CHANGES

**Process**:
1. **BEFORE code changes**: Document issue in CONTEXT.md
   - Detailed problem description
   - Technical details and error messages
   - Impact assessment
   - Timestamp

2. **AFTER code changes**: Update CONTEXT.md
   - Mark as completed
   - Document implementation details
   - List files modified with line numbers
   - Testing checklist
   - Timestamp

**Why**: User directive to prevent incomplete documentation gaps

### Code Quality Standards
- **No console.log in production**: Debug statements removed
- **No browser alerts**: EECOL-branded modal system only
- **Error logging preserved**: console.error maintained
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, production-ready code

### Development Patterns

#### File Organization
- Page-centric architecture (HTML + dedicated JS/CSS)
- Core services in src/core/ directory
- Shared utilities for common functionality
- Industry standards and product data modules

#### Data Management
- IndexedDB used as main storage, with localStorage as fallback if IndexedDB isn't working
- Gun.js P2P infrastructure implemented but non-functional sync mechanics
- localStorage used for UI state fallback when IndexedDB unavailable
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

#### User Experience
- EECOL-branded modal dialogs for all user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Accessibility considerations (keyboard nav, ARIA)
- Progressive enhancement (core works everywhere)

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Naming Conventions
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `updatePayloadSummary()`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `multi-cut-planner.js`)
- **CSS Classes**: BEM methodology or utility classes
- **IDs**: camelCase (e.g., `unassignedLengthsList`)

### Git Workflow
- **Main Branch**: `main` - Production releases
- **Development Branch**: `edge` - Active development
- **Commit Messages**: `type(scope): description`
  - feat: New features
  - fix: Bug fixes
  - docs: Documentation
  - refactor: Code improvements
  - style: Formatting

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing for UI/UX features
- Jest for unit testing (future)
- Cypress for E2E testing (future)
- Real browser testing for PWA features

## Learnings & Project Insights

### What Works Well
- **Page-centric architecture**: Easy to maintain and understand
- **IndexedDB-first storage**: Reliable, performant, transaction-safe
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lower maintenance overhead, no framework lock-in
- **EECOL modal system**: Consistent, professional user experience
- **Industry standards module**: Centralized wire specifications

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- **localStorage race conditions**: Migrated to IndexedDB
- **Async database issues**: Proper await/async patterns
- **Browser alert() calls**: Replaced with modal system
- **Console pollution**: Removed debug statements from production
- **Incomplete documentation**: Two-step documentation process enforced

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always read files before editing**: Prevents blind edits
2. **Document before and after changes**: Complete change tracking
3. **Test in real browser**: IndexedDB/PWA features need browser environment
4. **Mobile-first design**: Ensure functionality on all devices
5. **Preserve error logging**: Keep console.error for debugging

### Performance Considerations
- **Debounce input handlers**: Prevent excessive updates
- **Throttle sync operations**: Avoid network flooding
- **Lazy load heavy features**: Faster initial page load
- **Index optimization**: Fast IndexedDB queries

### Security Practices
- **No hardcoded credentials**: Environment variables for config
- **Input validation**: All user data validated
- **Shop network containment**: P2P only on secure networks
- **Encrypted storage**: Sensitive data encrypted

## Current Technical Debt
- Live Statistics localStorage fallback crash (needs investigation)
- Reel Size Estimator bugs (user-reported, needs investigation)
- Some pages still need PWA offline enhancement
- Education hub content needs expansion
- Feedback system needs implementation
